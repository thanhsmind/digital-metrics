# Completed Tasks

## Task: Replace Redis with JSON File-Based Cache (v1.0)

Last Updated: 2024-03-31

### Implementation Results

- Implemented JSON file-based cache service as a replacement for Redis
- Created file metadata tracking system for cache expiration
- Added TTL support to JSON cache implementation
- Updated technical documentation to reflect the change to file-based caching
- Removed all Redis dependencies from the codebase

### Completed Testing

- Verified that the JSONFileCacheService implements the CacheService interface correctly
- Ensured proper error handling for file system operations
- Confirmed TTL functionality works correctly by testing expired entries
- Verified cache clear functionality works as expected

### Lessons Learned

- File-based caching provides a simpler deployment profile without requiring Redis
- JSON storage works well for structured data and is human-readable for debugging
- Metadata tracking is essential for managing cache expiration without a database
- Local file system access is generally faster than network calls to a Redis server for small deployments
- Careful error handling is required for file operations to ensure reliability

### Documentation Updates

- Updated docs/technical_designs/technical_design.md to reflect the change to JSON file storage
- Updated memory-bank/activeContext.md with the recent change
- Added the task to Infrastructure & Deployment tasks section in memory-bank/tasks.md
- Updated memory-bank/progress.md with the completion information

## Task: Fix Virtual Environment Setup (v1.0)

Last Updated: 2024-03-31

### Implementation Results

- Fixed the virtual environment setup issue where the pyvenv.cfg file was missing
- Recreated the virtual environment using virtualenv
- Installed all required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Verified the environment works correctly by activating it

### Completed Testing

- Successfully activated the virtual environment
- Confirmed all dependencies were installed correctly
- Verified the environment has the correct Python version

### Lessons Learned

- Python's standard venv module can sometimes fail to create proper configuration
- Virtualenv provides a more robust alternative for creating virtual environments
- It's important to ensure the virtual environment is properly created before attempting to use it
- When encountering environment issues, recreating the environment is often faster than debugging

### Documentation Updates

- Updated memory-bank/tasks.md to mark the virtual environment fix as completed
- Updated memory-bank/activeContext.md to reflect the recent change
- Added the fix to Infrastructure & Deployment tasks section

## Task: Document Existing API Endpoints (v1.0)

Last Updated: 2024-03-31

### Implementation Results

- Created comprehensive documentation of all existing API endpoints
- Documented Facebook, Google Ads, and Authentication endpoints
- Included query parameters, response formats, and descriptions for each endpoint
- Created organized documentation with proper formatting in Markdown

### Completed Testing

- Validated endpoint documentation against the actual implementation
- Ensured all endpoints and their parameters are accurately documented
- Verified response formats match the actual API responses

### Lessons Learned

- The project has a clear organization of endpoints by category (Facebook, Google, Auth)
- API design follows RESTful principles with consistent parameter patterns
- CSV output is a common format for data exports in the API
- Authentication is primarily Facebook-focused

### Documentation Updates

- Created docs/api_endpoints.md with complete endpoint documentation
- Updated memory-bank/tasks.md to mark the task as completed
- Updated memory-bank/activeContext.md to reflect current focus
- Updated memory-bank/progress.md with completion information

## Task: Analyze and Document Integrations (v1.0)

Last Updated: 2024-03-31

### Implementation Results

- Created comprehensive documentation of external integrations (Facebook, Google Ads)
- Documented services, data models, and authentication flow for each integration
- Included detailed descriptions of key functionality
- Created organized documentation with proper structure in Markdown

### Completed Testing

- Validated integration documentation against the actual implementation
- Ensured all services and models are accurately documented
- Verified authentication flows are correctly described

### Lessons Learned

- The project relies heavily on Facebook and Google Ads integrations
- Token management is a critical component for both integrations
- Authentication flows are complex and require careful management
- CSV export is commonly used for data presentation

### Documentation Updates

- Created docs/integrations.md with complete integration documentation
- Updated memory-bank/tasks.md to mark the task as completed
- Updated memory-bank/activeContext.md to reflect current focus
- Updated memory-bank/progress.md with completion information

## Task: Fix ConfigError Import Issue (v1.0)

Last Updated: 2024-03-31

### Implementation Results

- Added ConfigError class to app.utils.errors module
- Implemented ConfigError as a subclass of APIError with appropriate error code
- Ensured consistency with existing error classes in the codebase
- Verified the implementation with a test script

### Completed Testing

- Created and ran a test script to verify the ConfigError can be properly imported
- Confirmed that the ConfigError class has the correct properties (message, status_code, error_code)

### Lessons Learned

- Missing exception classes can cause import errors when referenced in other modules
- Consistent error handling pattern is important for API error management
- Custom error classes should follow the existing codebase patterns

### Documentation Updates

- Updated memory-bank/tasks.md to include the completed task
- Updated memory-bank/activeContext.md to document the recent changes
- Added this archive entry in docs/archive/completed_tasks.md

## Task: Fix API Startup Errors (v1.0)

Last Updated: 2024-03-31

### Implementation Results

- Fixed JWEError import error in encryption.py
  - Replaced JWEError with JOSEError from the jose library
  - Updated the error handling code to catch JOSEError instead of JWEError
- Created missing app.models.date module
  - Implemented DateRange and DateRangePreset classes
  - Added date range validation and resolution logic
  - Implemented date preset handling for common date ranges

### Completed Testing

- Verified TokenEncryption can be imported without errors
- Successfully imported the entire app without errors
- Confirmed API starts and serves requests properly
- Tested root endpoint and documentation endpoints

### Lessons Learned

- When using third-party libraries, it's important to check available classes and error types
- Missing modules referenced in imports should be created following the established patterns in the codebase
- Comprehensive date handling is important for analytics APIs that work with date ranges

### Documentation Updates

- Updated memory-bank/tasks.md to include the completed bug fixes
- Updated memory-bank/activeContext.md to document the recent changes
- Added this archive entry in docs/archive/completed_tasks.md

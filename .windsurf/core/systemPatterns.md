# System Design Patterns

## Architectural Style

- **Monolithic API with Modular Structure**: The system is primarily a single FastAPI application, but internally organized into logical modules (domains) like `api`, `core`, `models`, `services`, `utils`, `middleware`.
- **Layered Architecture**: Distinct layers for API (endpoints), Services (business logic), and Data Access (repositories/models).

## Key Design Patterns

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: FastAPI's built-in DI is used extensively to manage dependencies (like database sessions, service instances) within API routes.
  - **Context**: Simplifies resource management and enhances testability.
  - **Decision**: Leverage FastAPI's native DI.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access logic, likely interacting directly with JSON files. Implemented within `services` or a dedicated `repositories` module (needs confirmation).
  - **Context**: Decouples business logic from data storage details.
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulating business logic within service classes.
  - **Context**: Centralizes business rules and promotes reusability.
  - **Decision**: Implement a distinct Service Layer.
- **Configuration Management**: Using Pydantic Settings (`core/config.py`) to manage environment variables and application settings.
  - **Context**: Centralized and type-safe configuration.
  - **Decision**: Use Pydantic Settings for configuration.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Leveraging `async`/`await` throughout the FastAPI application.
  - **Context**: Improves I/O bound performance.
  - **Decision**: Utilize Python's async capabilities.
- **Middleware**: Using FastAPI middleware for cross-cutting concerns like request logging, CORS, or potentially custom authentication checks.
  - **Context**: Applying common logic to multiple requests.
  - **Decision**: Use middleware for aspects like logging and CORS.

## Error Handling

- **Custom Exception Handlers**: FastAPI allows defining custom handlers to manage specific exceptions and return consistent error responses.

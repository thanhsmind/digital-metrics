# Task Log: Fix Markdown Linting Errors in Core Memory Files

## Task Information

- **Date**: 2025-04-29 (Placeholder)
- **Time Started**: HH:MM (Placeholder)
- **Time Completed**: HH:MM (Placeholder)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `d:\projects\digital-metrics\.windsurf\core\productContext.md`
  - `d:\projects\digital-metrics\.windsurf\core\activeContext.md`
  - `d:\projects\digital-metrics\.windsurf\core\systemPatterns.md`
  - `d:\projects\digital-metrics\.windsurf\core\techContext.md`

## Task Details

- **Goal**: Resolve all reported markdownlint errors (MD009, MD012, MD022, MD032) in the core Windsurf Memory Bank files to ensure documentation consistency and adherence to standards.
- **Implementation**:
  - Iteratively applied edits to `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.
  - Addressed issues related to trailing spaces (MD009), multiple consecutive blank lines (MD012), and missing blank lines around headings (MD022) and lists (MD032).
  - Multiple attempts were needed for `techContext.md` due to the `edit_file` tool inserting unintended spaces on blank lines.
  - The final edits successfully enforced single, empty blank lines where required and removed extraneous whitespace.
- **Challenges**: The `edit_file` tool repeatedly inserted blank lines with a single space instead of empty lines, requiring multiple correction attempts for `techContext.md`.
- **Decisions**: Persisted with focused `edit_file` calls, refining the instruction to explicitly request empty lines, which eventually succeeded.

## Performance Evaluation

- **Score**: 20/23 (Excellent base, deduction for tool struggle)
- **Strengths**:
  - Successfully identified and fixed all targeted linting errors across multiple files (+10).
  - Followed markdown style conventions perfectly in the final state (+3).
  - Handled edge cases related to spacing around lists and headings (+2).
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Initial edits sometimes overcorrected or undercorrected spacing (-2).
  - Encountered difficulty getting the `edit_file` tool to produce truly empty blank lines without spaces, requiring multiple retries (-3 for inefficiency).
- **Penalties Applied**: -5 (Inefficient process due to tool issues)
- **Rewards Applied**: +15 (Successful fix, good style, handled spacing cases)
- **Rationale**: While the final outcome is correct and meets standards, the process was inefficient due to struggles with the editing tool, slightly reducing the score from perfect.

## Next Steps

- Await further instructions from the USER for the next task.
- Continue monitoring documentation for any new linting issues.
